 # Mollie's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is my Prework Study Guide for my upcoming Coding Bootcamp course at UCF! My motivation was to get 100% ready before I start
my coding journey. I built this project to relearn and even discover new things about barebones coding. I knew most of the HTML and CSS
information, but it was great to touch up on. The Javascript portion was completely new to me and was a bit challenging, so I'm glad I got the chance to try it out before the real course begins.
